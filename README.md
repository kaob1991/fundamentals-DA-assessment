# fundamentals-assessment

This repository has 2 Jupyter notebooks, one for pyplot and another for CAO points comparisons. It also contains a .txt file which should not be modified as it contains important configuration files which Binder requires to run correctly. 

This repository is submitted as partial fullfillment of a H.Dip in Data Analytics in Computing
